      To address stress, we can consider the following strategies:
      
      1) Psychotherapy: Engaging in therapy sessions with a qualified professional can provide valuable support and guidance.
      2) Physical activity: Participating in regular exercise or sports activities can help reduce stress and promote overall well-being.
      3) Support network: Building a strong support network with coworkers and friends outside of work can provide emotional support and a sense of community.
      During an exploratory interview, we can discuss what you're experiencing and provide feedback. We'll identify if the stress is related to work, personal life, or a major life crisis. Understanding the focus of the stress is crucial.
      
      If the stress is related to emotional exhaustion (AE), we can focus on providing tools to better manage emotions. For example, practicing meditation or discussing your feelings with someone outside your work area, such as friends or coworkers from different departments.
      
      If the stress is related to depersonalization (D), we can explore activities that promote bonding with coworkers outside the workplace. Additionally, recognizing and celebrating achievements, taking initiative, and making improvement proposals can be effective strategies.
      
      If the stress is related to a lack of professional accomplishment (RP), we can focus on career planning and future projection. Taking actions that add value, studying relevant content related to your role, positively influencing others, and reflecting on your purpose can help alleviate stress.
      
      Please organize your thoughts and let me know if there's anything specific you would like assistance with.
